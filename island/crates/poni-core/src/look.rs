//! How the island paints in each theme: its ground, its ink and its accents.
//!
//! Pages and activities draw in one vocabulary, the Classic island's: a black
//! ground, white content at some opacity (text, icons, washes, tracks) and a
//! few system-style accents (`geom::palette`). A [`Look`] maps that vocabulary
//! onto its own colours as the canvas paints, so every page follows the theme
//! without knowing about it, including pages written later.
//!
//! * Greys (white, black and everything between, at any opacity) are read as
//!   "white at that brightness over the black island" and repainted between
//!   the look's ground and ink: Classic's white text becomes the ink, its 8 %
//!   white wash becomes an 8 % ink wash, the black island becomes the ground.
//! * The palette's accents swap for the look's own, with a deeper shade for
//!   text so small coloured labels stay readable on a light ground.
//! * Anything else (album-art colours, `palette::ON_ACCENT`)
//!   is left alone.
//!
//! A look also says what the island is made of: Classic and Pill paint a
//! solid ground, Glass draws liquid glass there (gfx and the glass shader)
//! and paints content in the light or dark Glass look on top. And its
//! shape: every theme hangs from the top edge like a notch, except Pill,
//! which floats below it as a capsule (`crate::settings::Theme::Pill`).
